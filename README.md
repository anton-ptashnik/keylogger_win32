# keylogger_win32

The application was developed for tracking pressed keys on a keyboard. Symbolic representation of each keyboard key that's been pressed is written to a log file.

Pay attention: you must enter the password when you want to close the application. The password is the string "pass:" concatenated with the result of dividing the number of current seconds by the number 3. If the result of dividing is a number that lesser than 10, you must put a zero before it.
